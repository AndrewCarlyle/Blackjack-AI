# Blackjack-AI
Artificial intelligence agent that plays the game of Blackjack (21)

The master branch of this repository implements a Temporal Difference Learning Agent that learns to play the game of Blackjack throughout many learning rounds, and then takes what it has learned to play validation rounds.

THe simple-reflex-agent branch does not do any learning, but instead just chooses to hit/stand based on a single threshold value for the sum of its cards.
